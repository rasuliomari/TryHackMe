DNS Record Types

DNS isn't just for websites though, and multiple types of DNS record exist. We'll go over some of the most common ones that you're likely to come across.

1. A Record
These records resolve to IPv4 addresses, for example 104.26.10.229

2. AAAA Record
These records resolve to IPv6 addresses, for example 2606:4700:20::681a:be5

3. CNAME Record
These records resolve to another domain name, for example, TryHackMe's online shop has the subdomain name store.tryhackme.com which returns a CNAME record shops.shopify.com. Another DNS request would then be made to shops.shopify.com to work out the IP address.
