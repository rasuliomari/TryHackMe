Why Do Organizations Need Security?
As the internet age transforms how organizations work worldwide, it also brings challenges. While there is no doubt that technology has made the life of organizations a lot easier by opening new avenues of collaboration and innovation, we often hear about organizations getting hacked, losing customer data, getting ransomed, and facing other types of cyber attacks. In responding to these threats, organizations can either go back to the old ways of doing business without getting any aid from modern technology, putting them at a disadvantage, or they can move forward and ensure the security of the digital side of their business. Hence, just like any organization will protect its physical assets and dedicate whole departments to them, a company's digital assets must also be secured. It must be noted here that organizations do all of this to ensure their primary goal is achieved without hindrance. 

The Role of a Security Engineer
Keeping in view the above-mentioned need for security, organizations hire security engineers. In order to hire a security engineer, an organization perceives a security engineer as someone who:
1. Owns the overall security of an organization. The main person responsible for securing an organization's digital assets.
2. Ensures that the organization's cyber security risk is minimized at all times.
3. Devises strategies and creates systems that minimize the risk posed by cyber security threats to an organization.
4. Periodically conducts tests to ensure the robustness of the cyber security posture of an organization, identifies weak points, and prepares mitigations.
