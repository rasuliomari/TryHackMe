In the previous task, we established that a security engineer is responsible for an organization's security posture. In this task, we will expand on the general expectations that an organization has from a security engineer in order to help them achieve their goals in this role. Although loosely defined, a security engineer will often be responsible for the areas that follow.

1. Asset Management/Asset Inventory
One of the primary steps in ensuring an organization's security is to maintain an organization's asset inventory. In terms of cyber security, this will mean managing and maintaining an inventory of an organization's digital assets. Security engineers can only own an organization's security if they know what assets the organization has. They must also ensure that this asset inventory is regularly maintained and updated and includes all the required information about assets such as asset name, type, IP addresses, physical location, place in the network, applications running on an asset, access permissions (only within the organization or public-facing), and the asset owner details.
