In the previous task, we established that a security engineer is responsible for an organization's security posture. In this task, we will expand on the general expectations that an organization has from a security engineer in order to help them achieve their goals in this role. Although loosely defined, a security engineer will often be responsible for the areas that follow.

1. Asset Management/Asset Inventory
One of the primary steps in ensuring an organization's security is to maintain an organization's asset inventory. In terms of cyber security, this will mean managing and maintaining an inventory of an organization's digital assets. Security engineers can only own an organization's security if they know what assets the organization has. They must also ensure that this asset inventory is regularly maintained and updated and includes all the required information about assets such as asset name, type, IP addresses, physical location, place in the network, applications running on an asset, access permissions (only within the organization or public-facing), and the asset owner details.

2. Security Policies
An organization needs robust security policies to maintain a sound security posture. A security engineer helps the organization create security policies based on established Security Principles. These policies are then implemented organization-wide, and the security engineer ensures that the implementation follows the letter and spirit of the policies. Sometimes, a need arises for granting exceptions to the security policies due to business needs. In such scenarios, the security engineer consults the security principles to allow or deny exceptions and suggest mitigating steps to minimize risks. 

3. Secure by Design
A security engineer ensures that the organization is secure by design. The engineer understands that the security posture receives the most Return on Investment (ROI) if it follows a secure-by-design philosophy. This means that the security engineer takes steps to implement a Secure Network Architecture (room coming soon!), ensures the organization's Windows, Linux, and Active Directory are hardened, and software development follows the Secure Software Development Lifecycle.

4. Security Assessment and Assurance
While securely designing the organization's network and infrastructure might be an excellent first step, a security engineer understands that their job is far from done after that. They understand that security is hard work that requires continuous effort. While a security engineer must ensure everything is done correctly, a compromise requires just one loophole to be successful. To mitigate risks from a continuously evolving threat landscape, a security engineer plans to conduct regular security assessments, audits, and red-teaming and purple-teaming exercises to continuously improve the security posture. While security engineers might not be performing assessments and audits themselves, they are primarily involved in helping schedule these activities, creating Request for Quotations (RFQs) for external parties to perform these activities, and helping prioritize and implement the findings from them.
