Congratulations! We have made it to the challenging part for the adversaries!

At this stage, we have levelledï»¿ up our detection capabilities against the artifacts. The attacker would most likely give up trying to break into your network or go back and try to create a new tool that serves the same purpose. It will be a game over for the attackers as they would need to invest some money into building a new tool (if they are capable of doing so), find the tool that has the same potential, or even gets some training to learn how to be proficient in a certain tool. 

Attackers would use the utilities to create malicious macro documents (maldocs) for spearphishing attempts, a backdoor that can be used to establish C2 (Command and Control Infrastructure), any custom .EXE, and .DLL files, payloads, or password crackers.

A Trojan dropped the suspicious "Stealer.exe" in the Temp folder:
